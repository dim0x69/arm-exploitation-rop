The script collection in the folder initial_image will create the virtual ARM environment. 

1) 
To create the initial bootable image change into "initial_image" and execute the scripts in the given order.

After you executed all scripts, the following files and folder will appear:

* ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz - downloaded by 0_download_archlinuxarm.sh

* archlinux/ and initramfs-linux-full.img - created by 2_create_initramfs.sh. The initramfs will contain all linux modules - yes all. 
The resulting initramfs will be huge, but it is much easier that may to initially boot a qemu maschine since all supported modules will
be available.

* armbox.img - the root filesysstem

* zImage - the Kernel


2) 
4_ will  boot the initial image using the files mentioned above. 

Start the image and execute: 

mkinitcpio -p linux-armv7

Username and password is root

A fitting initramfs will be created for the machine.

3) 
copy the armbox.img from initial_image into archlinux-latest

4)
execute 1_get_latest_initramfs.sh to extract the latest zImage and initramfs from the image

5) 
you can boot now using 2_start_armbox_latest.sh

6)
dhcpcd eth1 shoud give you a NATed IP (any maybe internet)
