The script in initial_image will create a initramfs which contains all modules which the
latest ArchlinuxARM ships. The resulting initramfs will be huge, but it is much easier
that may to initially boot a qemu maschine since all supported modules will
be available.

create initial bootable image inside the initial_image folder by executing  the scripts 0_ - 4_

4_ will  boot the initial image. Update the image, if the kernel is updated a fitting
initramfs will be created for the maschine - this will be extracted by the script 
'1_get_latest_initramfs.sh'

# copy the armbox.img from initial_image into archlinux-latest

# execute 1_get_latest_initramfs.sh to extract the latest zImage and initramfs from the image

# you can boot now using 2_start_armbox_latest.sh
